## Description

This project uses MongoDB and Mongoose to build and structure an API for a social network. Users can share their thoughts, react to their friends thoughts and create a friend list. I have used a NoSQL database due to the unstructured nature of the data.

## Installation

The project will need to be cloned from the github repo, once this is done please run npm install to download the relevant dependencies for the project. After the install has completed running npm start will begin the server to test the API.

## Usage

This project shows how the back end of a social network API would function using a NoSQL database. There are different models that interact with each other that allow a user to add or remove friends, to edit their information and to create thoughts. These thoughts can be edited or deleted and a user can react to their friends thoughts. This is done using a CRUD API.
